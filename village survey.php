        <h6>Village Survey</h6>
        <p>
          Students had visited the adopted village on 15th nov, 2022 and made a survey of it:<br>
          It was an underdeveloped village where the minimum necessities were at stake. As we had visited the village, we’ve enlightened ourselves of the other side of India. We went and spoke to the villagers about their grievances. We prepared a questionnaire i.e., survey form, consisting of their personal and educational factors, facilities and their problems regarding to the minimum facilities that have to be provided to them. Visiting the village made us realize how fortunate we are to havemore than minimum facilities  being provided, it’s disheartening to see people living and studying in dilapidated schools and houses, impure drinking water, kacha roads, untidy society and no proper sanitation facility. Thus, we’ve decided to adopt the village and provide them the minimum necessities. In a nut shell, it was a great and educational experience, visiting and surveying the village.
